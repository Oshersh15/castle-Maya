# castle-Maya
creating a castle using Python in Maya software

My code creates the outer part of a castle that is standing on top of a terrain. In my code I created a round building, a brick wall and a terrain that are being arranged based on the user’s choice. The user is presented with a user interface window and can determine the level of mountainous for the terrain and can determine the attributes of the round buildings such as radius, height and location on the terrain (x-axis and z-axis). The program will already know to determine the y-position based on the area of the terrain the building is standing on. After that the user can press on the ‘create castle’ button and the brick walls will arrange themselves appropriately
